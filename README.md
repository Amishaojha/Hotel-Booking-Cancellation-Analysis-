Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
üè©Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis using Excel

This is my project where I have done Hotel Booking Cancellation data using Excel 

Project Highlights:
1) Leveraged Excel for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Assumptions about cancellation:
The type of hotel decides the cancelation rate with higher cancellations in city hotels as compared to resort hotels due to variety of facilities available in resort hotels.
Customers who have bookings for longer durations have lesser chance of cancelling their booking.
If there are high previous cancellations, possibility of cancellation of current booking is also high.
If room assigned is not the same as reserved room type, customer might positively cancel the booking.

Conclusion:
‚Ä¢ Cancellation is higher in August by Couples
